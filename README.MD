 # HTML

The HTML file is useful for the content of the website, for exemple if we want to have some image we will use the HTML file. 

I used the ` <div> ` element  which will allow me to use css file with the classe, the id or the element selector .


 # CSS 
 The CSS file is useful for the style of the page. For exemple if we want to  
 have a page who is blue, we wil need a to have a class,a id in the css file and it will have the following command. 



   
    .backgroud{
            background-color: #020E35; }
    


# Flex 
The flexible box layout module (usually referred to as flexbox) is a dimensional layout model for distributing space between items and includes numerous alignment capabilities. 

In the css file, i used the `display: felx` to put the element next to each other.


# Grid
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns.

The elements can be placed onto the grid within these column and row lines.
